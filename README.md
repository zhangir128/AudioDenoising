# AudioDenoising

To train the model the program uses U-Net Architecture.
The U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture originally designed for biomedical image segmentation. It has since been adapted for various applications, including audio denoising. The U-Net's architecture is characterized by an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections between the corresponding layers of the encoder and decoder. This design enables the network to learn both low-level and high-level features, which allows it to accurately capture the structure and patterns in the input data.
